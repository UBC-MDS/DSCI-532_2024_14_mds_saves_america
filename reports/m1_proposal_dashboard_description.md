## App Sketch and Dashboard Description
The main page of the app presents a summary of the survey data, providing general statistics and comparisons related to American elections. The main page is divided into two sections: general correlations regarding political affiliations and opinions on American survival, and the elections section, which covers public opinion on Donald Trump.

In the general correlations section:
- Stacked bar charts illustrate the breakdown of Americans' political affiliations by demographics such as race and education level.
- A bar chart displays the likelihood of war as perceived by Americans, compared with their beliefs about America's survival over a century.

The elections section focuses on perceptions surrounding Donald Trump:
- A donut chart depict the likelihood of Trump's re-election in relation to individuals' concerns about their monetary situation.
- A frequency table examines approval of Trump and beliefs about the fairness of vote counting during elections.

All comparative statistical distributions can be filtered via the top filtering pane, allowing users to filter by age range, education level, political ideology, and race using dropdown menus and sliders. The color scheme chosen for the app is inspired by the American flag, using different colors to distinguish between groups in chart breakdowns.
