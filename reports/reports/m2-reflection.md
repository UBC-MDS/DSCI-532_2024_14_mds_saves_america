# Reflection

## Implementation Status

Our dashboard, "The Future of Democracy and American Elections," aimed to offer an in-depth analysis of public sentiment towards American politics in August 2018. We planned to include a variety of interactive elements such as demographic filters (age, race, education level, political ideology), and visualization components (bar charts, donut charts, tabulated data) to enable users to explore the dataset effectively.

We successfully effectively presented complex data through visualizations that cater to various aspects of American political opinions and demographics. The use of interactive sliders and demographic dropdown filters  allows for dynamic exploration of the data, and the color-coded bar and pie charts provide at-a-glance insights into political affiliations and opinions on key issues like the likelihood of war and election fairness.

Current limitations include a single-screen layout that may hamper quick interpretation, an inability to directly compare demographic groups side by side, and the absence of a summary banner to communicate overarching narratives or conclusions. Additionally, lacking hover-over details on data points restricts the immediate availability of specific information. 

## Deviations from the Proposal

Instead of implementing a static tabulated data view, we decided to incorporate an interactive table that users can sort and filter. This change was made to enhance the dashboard's interactivity and user engagement, allowing for a more personalized exploration of the data. We found this approach more effective in providing users with the specific insights they are interested in, rather than a fixed data presentation.

## Current Strengths

The dashboard excels in offering a customizable and interactive exploration of political sentiment data, particularly through its demographic filters and dynamic bar charts. Users can effectively dissect the data according to specific demographics of interest, making the tool valuable for in-depth analysis.

## Future Improvements

To address the current limitations and enhance the dashboard, we plan to:

- A responsive design that accommodates multiple screen sizes for accessibility and convenience.
- Comparative views to allow for direct juxtaposition of different demographic data, enhancing analytical depth.
- A dashboard summary or highlights section that succinctly conveys key findings or trends to viewers without the need for in-depth analysis.
- Implementing hover-over tooltips for immediate data reading and to facilitate understanding without clicking.
- Add an icon to the dashboards
- Layout improvements to enhance the visual appeal and user experience:
  - Better spacing and alignment of elements for clarity and readability (Add padding to the table).
  - Consistent color schemes and design elements for a cohesive look.
  - Add nav bar back and put all the filters in one row.

Such enhancements will increase the dashboard's usability and provide a more comprehensive analytical tool for understanding public opinion dynamics in the political sphere.
