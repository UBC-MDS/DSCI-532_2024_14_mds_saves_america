# Milestone 3 Reflection

During Milestone 3, several enhancements were made to address feedback received during Milestones 1 and 2. Below are the key changes:

## Layout Changes

- Fixed the layout of the dashboard to ensure that all charts and filters fit within a single page layout, addressing feedback regarding page fitting issues.
- Emphasized the separation between the "General Correlations" and "Donald Trump Focused Data" sections by adjusting title headings and centering charts within their respective sections.
- Replaced the table chart in the initial design with a heatmap, as recommended by Joel, to better visualize voting fairness perception vs. approval of Donald Trump. The heatmap is more intuitive for identifying trends and aligns better with the page aesthetics.
- Merged redundant legends for the left-hand stacked bar charts to streamline the visualization.
- Adjusted decimal places on chart axes to ensure appropriate precision.
- Improved visibility of the age range slider control by changing its color to red when a range is selected, aligning with the chosen color palette for the page.
- Corrected additional white space to the right of the dashboard.
- Addressed alignment issues between all charts to ensure consistency and coherence.

## Bug Fixes

- Resolved an issue with the War Likelihood bottom-left bar chart not updating after filter selections, ensuring that the callback now functions correctly.
