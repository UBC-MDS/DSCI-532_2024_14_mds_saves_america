# Reflection

## Implementation Status

Our dashboard, "The Future of Democracy and American Elections," launched in August 2018, aimed to dissect American political sentiment through interactive visualizations. Despite some constraints, it succeeded in presenting multifaceted data engagingly. Key features include interactive elements like demographic filters (age, race, education, political ideology) and visualizations (stacked bar charts, donut charts) tailored for nuanced exploration. Users can dynamically filter data, enhancing engagement. Limitations such as the single-screen layout and lack of direct comparison hinder some user experiences. Notably, interactive tables replaced static views for a more engaging data interaction, despite the initial proposal for sortable tables—which remains under consideration for future updates.

## Deviations from the Proposal

We modified our approach from sortable to filter-only tables, recognizing current technical constraints but maintaining a commitment to improving user interaction in future iterations. This shift underscores our adaptability and focus on enhancing user engagement through interactive features.

## Current Strengths

Our dashboard stands out for its user-centric design, emphasizing customizable interactions and accessible visualizations. In choosing the color palette of blue, red, and white, we intentionally aligned with the hues of both the U.S. flag and the primary colors of the major political parties, fostering an intuitive and thematic connection for users. This choice underlines our commitment to an aesthetic that is not only visually appealing but also meaningful and contextually relevant. We opted for stacked bar and donut charts for their ease of interpretation. The introduction of multi-select dropdowns and an age slider—over grouped age buckets—offers users granular control over the data displayed, enhancing comparative analysis. The table format was chosen for its straightforwardness, catering to a broad audience's comprehension. Organizing the dashboard into sections on general demographic views versus those specifically regarding Donald Trump allows users to discern nuanced opinions effectively.

## Future Improvements

To refine our dashboard, we plan several enhancements:

- Implementing a responsive design for better accessibility across devices.
- Introducing comparative views for side-by-side demographic analyses, enriching the analytical experience.
- Adding a summary section to highlight key insights, offering viewers immediate understanding without deep dives.
- Incorporating hover-over tooltips for detailed data points, aiding quick information access.
- Introducing design improvements for a more appealing and intuitive user interface, including a cohesive color scheme, better element spacing, and a consolidated filter row with a navigational bar.

These updates aim to surpass current limitations, making the dashboard a more comprehensive tool for analyzing American political sentiments.
